macro:->The
table
shows
the
effects
of
individual
and
contextual-level
independent
variables
related
to
our
hypotheses;
however,
the
models
also
incorporate
the
control
variables
for
each
of
the
three
dependent
variables
separately
and
for
the
average
index
(complete
models
are
available
in
the

[appendix]{Appendix}).
